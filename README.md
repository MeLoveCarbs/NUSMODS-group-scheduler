## Demo of how this bot works:

1. Initialize the bot with `/start` and follow the instructions given by the bot.

2. Simply copy and paste as many nusmods timetable link as there are members on your group and the bot will generate the common timetable.

3. Wait for a moment and a common timeslot timetable will be generated for your group! Darker shades of red represents more members are unavailable, while lighter shades represents most members are free.

## Faq

**Q**: Can I add this bot to a group? <br>
**A**: Yes, you can add this bot to your group and members can individually add in their nusmods timetable link themselves.

**Q**: Why are some of the mods not shown on the generated timetable?<br>
**A**: Most of the NUS mods are working perfectly except for some of the mods that doesn't follow the "13 weeks per semester" convention. For eg, **NUR2120**. As such, they require more effort to be collated via the bot and it hasn't been implemented yet. Sorry! D:

**Note**: The telegram bot is being deployed in a free platform and hence, initializing the bot for the first time might be a tad bit slower if the bot hasn't been used for awhile.
